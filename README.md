<p align="center">Aggregated hosts blocklist, compiled nightly from <a href="https://firebog.net/">Firebog</a>'s "ticked" blocklists</p>

* Source blocklists are curated by [The Firebog](https://firebog.net/), and can be found [here](https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php?type=tick).
* The blocklist attempts to block suspicious, advertising, tracking and malicious domains.
* The list is updated nightly through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). [Here](.github/workflows/update-hosts.yaml)'s the code.
